							<a href=""><h2>India has been hit by a huge second coronavirus wave, but its government has said the pandemic is showing signs of slowing down in some regions.</h2></a>

							<p>posted by Claudiu Stefan</p>

							<p>India's surge in infections began around mid-March and increased rapidly, reaching a peak of more than 400,000 recorded daily cases on Friday, 30 April. Over subsequent days the numbers fell, with just under 360,000 on Monday, 3 May - leading to speculation that a peak had been reached. But in the past few days, they have started to rise again, in line with a weekly pattern of fluctuations that shows the numbers usually dipping on a Monday.</p>
